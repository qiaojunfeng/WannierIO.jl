# WannierIO.jl

A Julia package for reading/writing Wannier90 related files.

## Wannier90 files

Input files:

- `amn`
- `mmn`
- `eig`
- `chk`
- `UNK`
- `spn`

Also support parsing both plain text and binary formats (in Fortran language,
called `formatted` and `unformatted` IO, respectively) for some files, e.g.,
`chk` and `UNK`.

Output files:

- `*_band.dat`
- `*_tb.dat`
- `xsf`
- `cube`
- ...

## Quantum ESPRESSO files

To support comparing Wannier-interpolated band structures with density function
theory (DFT) bands, there are also some functions to parse Quantum ESPRESSO (QE)
output files:

- `xml`
- `bands.dat` generated by QE `bands.x`
